# SALES-DASHBOARD
This KPI-Based Regional-Revenue dashboard built in excel helps the coo  to easily track the overall state per every region.

# Project Title & Goal: 
The COO Had a monthly call with the Regional Sales Manager, but they were presenting their data in a different way 
and it was impossible to follow. So, we build a dashboard that helps with filtering by region, track monthly revenue
trends and help them compare performance year-over-year and also helping them compare performance across stores for
every region and identifying which specific products drove the biggest gains and losses in that region
